# Desktop Client

The desktop client's purpose is to interface and visualize telemetry data obtained from
the microcontrollers onboard UAVs and UGVs

The desktop client is a React application built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is wrapped in an
[electron](https://electronjs.org/) app that allows the React app to be ran in a desktop application.

This is the [tutorial that I used](https://flaviocopes.com/react-electron/) to set up this app.

## Setup

1. `npm install` installs dependencies for the react-electron application
2. `npm start` starts the electron-react desktop app
